# Drop Down Menu

This package will allow you to create a drop down menu by using an array. The elements in the array will be used as arguments for textContent, and href attribute value.

All you have to do is just querySelector a node to apply it, using appendChild(dropDownMenuMaker(arr))

An example would be:

```
js

import dropDownMenuMaker from "../dropDown-menu

const wordsToUse = ["Home", "About", "Partners];

dropDownMenuMaker(wordsToUse);


// This will create the dropDownMenuMaker
```
